The solution is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is used as a build tool. Unit tests are done using [Junit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/). No additional dependencies are used.

## Quickstart

Test the library using `./gradlew` (substitute `.\gradlew.bat` on Windows).

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```
